### ABOUT PROJECT NAME ("final-proj")
I am aware that it is supposed to be final-project but I have been running into issues where my live preview opens up the "simple pwa" assignemnt and I have no idea why, even naming it 'final-project' opened up pwa. Apparently naming it final-proj fixed this confusing issue. 
I kindly ask you don't deduct pts for this!

other files that also live preview PWA are:
homework-eight
final-project
homework-ten
